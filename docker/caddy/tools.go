// This module is a version-pinning manifest for the Caddy build; nothing here
// ships — xcaddy builds the real binary from these pins in its own module.
// The blank imports must stay untagged and in sync with build.sh: they keep
// `go mod tidy` (run by Dependabot on every update) from treating the
// requirements as unused and stripping the require block from go.mod, and
// they give CodeQL a buildable package to analyze (this is the repo's only
// Go module). xcaddy is pinned via the `tool` directive in go.mod because it
// only ships a main package, which cannot be imported.
//
// github.com/google/cel-go is intentionally absent: it has no root package
// and is already pulled in transitively by Caddy. Its compatibility version
// is managed through the replace directive in go.mod.
