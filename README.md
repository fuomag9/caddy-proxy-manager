## Overview

This project provides a web UI for Caddy Server, eliminating the need to manually edit JSON configurations or Caddyfiles. It handles reverse proxies, access lists, and certificate management through a shadcn/ui interface. Built with Next.js 16, React 19, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM, and TypeScript.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuomag9/caddy-proxy-manager.git
cd caddy-proxy-manager
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
docker compose up -d
```

Access at `http://localhost:3000/login`

Data persists in Docker volumes (caddy-manager-data, caddy-data, caddy-config, caddy-logs).

## Features

- **Proxy Hosts** - Reverse proxies with custom headers, multiple upstreams, load balancing (8 policies), active/passive health checks, retries, and enable/disable toggle
- **L4 Proxy Hosts** - TCP/UDP stream proxying with TLS SNI matching, proxy protocol (v1/v2), load balancing, health checks, and per-host geo blocking. Automatic Docker Compose port management via sidecar
- **Location Rules** - Path-based routing to different upstreams per proxy host (e.g. `/api/*` to one backend, `/ws/*` to another)
- **Redirect & Rewrite** - Per-host redirect rules (301/302/307/308) and path prefix rewriting
- **WAF** - Web Application Firewall powered by Coraza with optional OWASP Core Rule Set (SQLi, XSS, LFI, RCE). Per-host enable/disable, global and per-host rule suppression, custom SecLang directives, and a searchable event log with severity and blocked/detected classification
- **Analytics** - Live traffic charts, protocol breakdown, country map, top user agents, and blocked request log with configurable time ranges
- **Geo Blocking** - Block or allow traffic by country, continent, ASN, CIDR range, or exact IP per proxy host. Allow rules override block rules. Fail-closed mode, custom response codes/bodies, and trusted proxy support
- **Access Lists** - Multi-account HTTP basic auth protection (bcrypt-hashed) assignable per proxy host
- **Certificates** - Automatic HTTPS for every proxy host via Caddy ACME (Let's Encrypt / ZeroSSL), manual SSL/TLS import with expiry monitoring, and a built-in CA for issuing and revoking internal client certificates (mTLS)
- **mTLS** - Mutual TLS per proxy host using built-in CA certificates. Issue, track, and revoke client certificates

**Production Requirements:**
- `SESSION_SECRET`: 32+ characters (`openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: 12+ chars with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters

Development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`) allows default `admin`/`admin` credentials.

---


## Security

- Production enforces strong passwords (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, special characters)
- 32+ character session secrets required
- Login rate limiting: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
- Audit trail for all configuration changes
- Supports OAuth2/OIDC for SSO

**Production Setup:**
```bash
export SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="YourStr0ng-P@ssw0rd123!"
docker compose up -d
```

**Limitations:**
- Certificate private keys stored unencrypted in SQLite
- In-memory rate limiting (not suitable for multi-instance deployments)

---

## Certificate Management

Caddy automatically obtains Let's Encrypt certificates for all proxy hosts.

**Cloudflare DNS-01** (optional): Configure in Settings with a Cloudflare API token (`Zone.DNS:Edit` permissions).

**Custom Certificates** (optional): Import your own certificates via the Certificates page. Private keys are stored unencrypted in SQLite.

---

## Geo Blocking

Geo blocking is configured per proxy host. It requires MaxMind GeoLite2 databases (see [GeoIP Setup](#geoip-setup)).

### Rule types

| Type | Example | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Country | `DE` | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code |
| Continent | `EU` | `AF`, `AN`, `AS`, `EU`, `NA`, `OC`, `SA` |
| ASN | `24940` | Autonomous System Number |
| CIDR | `91.98.150.0/24` | IP range in CIDR notation |
| IP | `91.98.150.103` | Exact IP address |

Rules can be **block** or **allow**. Allow rules take precedence over block rules — you can block an entire continent and then allow specific IPs or ASNs through.

### GeoIP Setup

Geo blocking requires MaxMind GeoLite2 Country and/or ASN databases. Use the bundled `geoipupdate` service:

1. Register for a free MaxMind account at [maxmind.com](https://www.maxmind.com/)
2. Generate a license key with `GeoLite2-Country` and `GeoLite2-ASN` permissions
3. Add to your `.env`:
   ```
   GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
   GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key
   ```
4. Start with the `geoipupdate` profile:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile geoipupdate up -d
   ```

The databases are stored in the `geoip-data` Docker volume and shared between the web and Caddy containers.

## WAF (Web Application Firewall)

The WAF is powered by [Coraza](https://coraza.io/) and integrates the OWASP Core Rule Set.

Enable globally in **WAF → Settings**, then optionally override per proxy host. Two modes:
- **Block** — requests matching rules are rejected with 403
- **Detect** — requests are logged but not blocked

**OWASP CRS** covers SQLi, XSS, LFI, RCE, and more (enabled by default when WAF is on).

**Rule suppression** — suppress noisy rules globally or per host from the event detail drawer or the Suppressed Rules tab.

**Custom directives** — any ModSecurity SecLang syntax is accepted, e.g.:
```
SecRule REQUEST_URI "@beginsWith /api/" "id:9001,phase:1,ctl:ruleEngine=Off,nolog"
```

---

## Instance Sync

Run a master instance that pushes configuration to one or more slaves on every change.

```bash
# Master
INSTANCE_MODE=master
INSTANCE_SLAVES='[{"name":"replica","url":"https://replica.example.com","token":"<32-char-token>"}]'

# Slave
INSTANCE_MODE=slave
INSTANCE_SYNC_TOKEN=<32-char-token>
```

Synced data: proxy hosts, certificates, access lists, and settings. User accounts are **not** synced.

Use HTTPS slave URLs in production. Set `INSTANCE_SYNC_ALLOW_HTTP=true` only for internal Docker networks.

See the [Environment Variables Reference](https://github.com/fuomag9/caddy-proxy-manager/wiki/Environment-Variables-Reference) for all `INSTANCE_*` options.

---

## Upstream DNS Pinning

You can enable upstream DNS pinning globally (**Settings → Upstream DNS Pinning**) and override per host (**Proxy Host → Upstream DNS Pinning**).

When enabled, hostname upstreams are resolved during config save/reload and written to Caddy as concrete IP dials. Address family selection supports:
- `both` (preferred, resolves AAAA then A with IPv6 preference)
- `ipv6`
- `ipv4`

### Important HTTPS Limitation

If one reverse proxy handler contains multiple different HTTPS upstream hostnames, HTTPS pinning is skipped for those HTTPS upstreams to avoid TLS SNI mismatch. In that case, hostname dials are kept for those HTTPS upstreams.

HTTP upstreams in the same handler are still eligible for pinning.

---

## OAuth Authentication

Supports any OIDC-compliant provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0, etc.).

```bash
# Set your public URL (REQUIRED for OAuth to work)
BASE_URL=https://caddy-manager.example.com

OAUTH_ENABLED=true
OAUTH_PROVIDER_NAME="Authentik"  # Display name
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
OAUTH_ISSUER=https://auth.example.com/application/o/app/
```

**Redirect URI Configuration:**

You must configure this redirect URI in your OAuth provider:
```
{BASE_URL}/api/auth/callback/oauth2
```

Examples:
- `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/oauth2` (development)
- `https://caddy-manager.example.com/api/auth/callback/oauth2` (production)

The `BASE_URL` environment variable must match exactly where users access your dashboard.

OAuth login appears on the login page alongside credentials. Users can link OAuth to existing accounts from the Profile page.
